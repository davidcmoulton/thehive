## Summary

eLife is a non-profit organisation created by funders and led by researchers. Our mission is to accelerate discovery by operating a platform for research communication that encourages and recognises the most responsible behaviours.

## Peer review model

eLife works to improve the process of peer review so that it more effectively conveys the assessment of expert reviewers to authors, readers and other interested parties. This ambition is reflected in the transparency of our current process, where anyone can read the peer review reports and editors' assessment for all published eLife papers. In the future we envision a system in which the outputs of peer review are the primary way research is assessed, rather than journal title.

The main features of the current eLife peer-review process are:

*   all decisions are made by editors who are active researchers in the life and biomedical sciences.
*   editors and reviewers discuss their reviews with each other before reaching a decision on a manuscript; extra experiments are only requested if they are essential and can be completed within about two months.

The overall aim is to make peer review faster (by reducing rounds of revision and only requesting extra experiments when they are essential), fairer and more open. eLife does not support the Impact Factor and is a co-founder of the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA).
